# 02: Why Go?

Invented by Google.

Notable contributors:

* Ken Thompson (B, C, Unix, UTF-8)
* Rob Pike (Unix, UTF-8)
* Robert Griesemer (Hotspot, JVM)

> GO was invented by geniuses.

* High performance
* Multiple cores: Language written to leveage multiple cores easily.
* Concurrency: Not necessarily easier to code but "baked" into the runtime
* Compiled
  * can comile for other arcitechtures on one machine.
* Network

Basically, it does everything and loads of companies are using it.

# 03: Hello World

~~~ golang
package main
import "fmt"

func main(){
  fmt.Println("Hello, world!")
}
~~~

We start with a package declaration which identifies which package this code
belongs to.

Import is used to introduce libraries of code into our own projects.

golang.org vs godoc.org

godoc has the standard library *and* 3rd party libraries, golang.org only covers
the standard library.

## SHA1 checksum
Is a hash algorithm used to check that the download is unmodified.

~~~ bash
openssl sha1 path_to_downloaded_item
~~~

Verify the Go installation with

~~~
go version

# 07: Go workspace

The Go workspace:

* Some folder
  * bin
  * pkg
  * src
    * github.com
      * <github.com username>
        * folder with code for project/repo
        * folder with code for project/repo
        * folder with code for project/repo

# 10: How to configure Environement Variables on Mac

In terminal, head to user's root and edit `.bash_profile` (or `.bashrc`)

* $GOROOT should be pointed to `/usr/local/go`
* $GOPATH should be where ever you do your work, e.g `~/Documents/Coding/Go`
* add to $PATH the bin directory so your binaries are available everywhere.
  * `export PATH="$HOME/Documents/Coding/Go/bin:$PATH"`

# 22: Hello World... again?

~~~ golang
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
  fmt.Println("Hello. world!")
}

# 23: go Commands

`go help` will yield a list of go commands.

* `go run` is used to run
* `go build <filename>` builds the project and puts the executable into the working src folder.  The executatble will have the same name as the source file.
* `go build` build all the project file in the current folder. THe executable will have the name of the **containing** directory. So if you are in a directory `~/$GOPATH/src/github.com/RobCThompson/UdemyGoLangTraining` then the executable will be called UdemyGoLangTraining.
* `go clean` removes executable files from a working directory. .go source files are left intact.
* `go install` works the same as go buld except that it places the executable into the $GOPATH/bin directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 24 & 25: Github

Make sure that Git is installed.

Make sure you are in the project directory and initialise Git with `git init`.

Add the remote Github origin (if you are using it) with `git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo>` e.g `git remote add origin https://github.com/RobCThompson/UdemyGoLangTraining.git`.  Don't forget the `.git` extension!.

If the repository was created on Github with a README.md document or some other content then the repo's might not match so it's likely to be a good idea to *PULL* the remote repo before making changes to the local one.  Do this with `git pull origin master`.

Then, continue to use git as you would locally, i.e adding files with `git add <filename>` or `git add -all` and commiting with `git commit -m "a useful message"`.

If you then wish to push back to github do so with `git push -u origin master` or just `git push`.

Don't forget that `git status` is a useful command!
